      <p>Sonam Kapoor (born 9 June 1985) is an Indian film star and one of the highest-paid Bollywood actresses. The daughter of actor Anil Kapoor, she studied theatre and arts at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore. She became an assistant director to Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the film Black (2005), and made her acting debut in the romantic drama Saawariya (2007). She had her first commercial success three years later in the romantic comedy I Hate Luv Storys (2010), followed by a string of commercial failures. The financially successful Raanjhanaa (2013) marked a turning point in her career, earning her several Best Actress nominations. She played a princess in the melodrama Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (2015)—one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films—and garnered critical acclaim for portraying the titular role in the biographical thriller Neerja (2016), one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist. She is outspoken in support of breast cancer awareness, LGBT rights, and other causes. She has been nominated for four Filmfare Awards. (Full article...)

      <h2>Today's featured picture</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Charles_Kingley_-_1899_Westward_Ho%21_cover_2.jpg/300px-Charles_Kingley_-_1899_Westward_Ho%21_cover_2.jpg">
      <p>estward Ho! is an 1855 British historical novel by Charles Kingsley, set in the Elizabethan era and written in a mock Elizabethan tone. It follows the adventures of Amyas Leigh, who sets sail with Francis Drake and other privateers to the Caribbean, where they battle with the Spanish. Originally targeted at adults, Westward Ho! was deemed suitable for children due to its mixture of patriotism, sentiment and romance, and became a firm favourite of children's literature during the 19th century. In the 21st century it has become less popular because of its anti-Catholicism and its racist attitudes towards indigenous peoples.

Shown here is the cover to the 1899 Frederick Warne & Co edition of the novel.
